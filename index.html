        <h1>Welcome to MySite</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Zr0Trust, a security architect with over six years of experience building and protecting digital systems. My passion for security stems from a belief that technology should empower, not endanger. I’m fascinated by the ever-evolving challenge of staying ahead of threats in a connected world—and I’ve dedicated my career to mastering that craft.</p>
        <p>Through this site, I’ll be sharing insights on tech and security via blog posts. Expect deep dives into emerging trends, practical tips for safeguarding systems, and reflections on the intersection of innovation and protection. Whether you’re a fellow professional or just curious, I hope you’ll find something valuable here.</p>
